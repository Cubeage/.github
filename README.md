# Cubeage GitHub Actions Infrastructure

Org-wide GitHub Actions configuration and shared reusable workflows.

## macOS CI Runner

We run **3 self-hosted macOS runners** on our Kubernetes cluster (Talos/QEMU/Docker-OSX), providing free iOS builds instead of GitHub's expensive macOS-hosted runners (~$10/min).

- Runner labels: `self-hosted`, `macOS`, `X64`
- Xcode: 16.2 (16C5032a)
- Swift: 6.0.3
- Capacity: **3 concurrent iOS builds**

## iOS Builds — Quick Start

### Step 1: Add GitHub Secrets to your repo

Go to your repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` | Your Apple Distribution `.p12` cert, base64 encoded |
| `P12_PASSWORD` | Password you set when exporting the `.p12` |
| `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` | Your App Store `.mobileprovision`, base64 encoded |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | Any random strong string (e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32`) |

**How to encode your files:**
```bash
# On your Mac:
base64 -i Distribution.p12 | pbcopy          # → paste as BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64
base64 -i AppStore.mobileprovision | pbcopy   # → paste as PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64
```

**How to export your .p12:**
1. Open Keychain Access
2. Find your "Apple Distribution: ..." certificate
3. Right-click → Export → save as `.p12` with a password
4. Encode it: `base64 -i YourCert.p12 | pbcopy`

### Step 2: Create workflow file

Copy `.github/workflows/` → create `.github/workflows/ios-build.yml` in your repo:

```yaml
name: iOS Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    uses: Cubeage/.github/.github/workflows/ios-sign-and-build.yml@main
    with:
      scheme: YOUR_SCHEME_NAME    # replace with your Xcode scheme
      export-method: app-store    # app-store | ad-hoc | development
    secrets:
      BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64: ${{ secrets.BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64 }}
      P12_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.P12_PASSWORD }}
      PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64: ${{ secrets.PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64 }}
      KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD }}
```

That's it. The reusable workflow handles everything else.

## Security Model

Each build gets a **completely isolated temporary keychain** that is:
- Created fresh for every build run (name includes `run_id + run_attempt`)
- Deleted immediately after build completes (even on failure)
- Never shared between concurrent builds or different orgs

This is the same pattern used by GitHub's hosted runners and Fastlane match.

**What runs on the runner:**
- Xcode + system tools (persistent)
- Your source code (via `actions/checkout`, deleted after job)
- Your signing cert (temp keychain only, deleted after job)
- Your provisioning profile (UUID-named file, deleted after job)

**What never persists on the runner:**
- Your Apple ID credentials
- Your signing certificates
- Your provisioning profiles

---

## Simulator Builds (no signing required)

For unit tests or simulator builds, no secrets needed:

```yaml
- name: Test
  run: |
    xcodebuild test \
      -scheme MyApp \
      -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
      -configuration Debug
```

## Reusable Workflow Parameters

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `scheme` | (required) | Xcode scheme name |
| `configuration` | `Release` | `Debug` or `Release` |
| `export-method` | `app-store` | `app-store`, `ad-hoc`, `development`, `enterprise` |
| `xcode-path` | `/Applications/Xcode.app` | Path to Xcode.app |

---

## Multiple Signing Identities

Each repo manages its own secrets independently. Different repos in different orgs can have different Apple Developer accounts — there's no shared state on the runner.

---

## Runner Maintenance

Runners are managed by the Sylphx Platform team. For issues:
- Runner offline → check K8s pod: `kubectl get pods -n macos-runner`
- Xcode update → download from [xcodereleases.com](https://xcodereleases.com), SCP to runner port 30922
